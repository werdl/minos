# `minos`
> A Unix-like operating system written in Rust
## why
- I want to learn how to write an operating system
- but i don't want to write it in C (i have already written a kernel in C)
- i wanted to write a project hopefully approachable to beginner contributors who want to work on a more complex project
## philosophy
- `minos` is a Unix-like operating system
- so it follows the Unix philosophy - each tool should do one thing and do it well
